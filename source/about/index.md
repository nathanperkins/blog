My name is John McBride and I am a Denver, Colorado based Software Engineer.

In my current role, I work with cloud credit card software where I have repeatedly developed global, multi million dollar solutions, micro-services, and systems.

Additionally, I am a Teaching Assistant for the Oregon State University operating systems class where I assist students with programming assignments, perform extensive low level debugging, and create grading scripts for automated student testing.

Some of my interests include full stack development, web bots, block chain technologies, robotics, operating systems, unix, AI, algorithm design, and emerging web technology.

Otherwise, I am an avid rock climber & biker (moutain and road). I enjoy traveling, beer tasting, trail running, video games, playing guitar, exploring Denver, hiking, and so on.
