## Introduction

Moderation of online communities is no simple task. Often, large online groups of people will sucum to trolls, predetors, or other problems. The ambiguity and annonamity of the internet makes it incredibly easy for people to cause problems. 

I am a moderator for the Oregon State University CS online Slack community, and even this group of students has had it's problems. In this article, I present a simple software solution to give power back to the admin group. This "Auto Mod" gave us the ability to quickly react to situations and have a better grasp of what is happening in our workspace.

## Automatic solutions

One of the keystones of Devops culture is a to approach problems with a "automatic" mindset. Some would call this "infrastructure automation". In short, problems that arise should be able automatically responded to. This mindset is at the heart of the OSU Auto mod project. The admins required tools that we could use to automatically respond to situations and view our community at a glimps. 

## Anonamous Messaging

One of the biggest concerns revolving around this project in the OSU community was the potential invasion of privacy. Unfortunately, the Slack API makes it incredibly easy to snoop on all public and private messages (check out my story on Slack snooping here: )
