Hello out there! This is a new blog and personal web site that I am started to serve as a place to put my thoughts about engineering methodologies, coding practices, new things I’ve learned, and projects I think are worth sharing.

I began my coding journey in high school after buying The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. I had never played an RPG of this caliber before and I had never attempted to make modifications to a video game. After discovering the in-game terminal, I was instantly hooked. Creating short game scripts to perform incredible feats or spawn scary monsters gave me a glimpse of what it’s like to make a computer do something you want. Throughout highschool and college, I began dabbling in different frameworks including imbedded programming, rudimentary web scripting, and basic computer graphics generation. 

I graduated from South Dakota State University in 2014 with my BS in Nursing. That’s a whole story in itself, but I slowly continued to pursue my passion with computers and coding through that time. Eventually, I started to take it more seriously and I found FreeCodeCamp and began learning JavaScript. After spending 4 years in nursing and becoming fairly fluent with JavaScript, I decided that I needed a career change. I had fallen in love with software engineering by this point and I finally decided to pursue something I am passionate about, so I went back to school for Computer Science at Oregon State University. It was an incredible journey and now, I currently work with micro-service technology using NodeJS, Go, and Docker.

I am passionate about efficient, beautiful code, back end infrastructure, agile methodologies, cryptocurrency, and unix. 

My Github is github.com/jpmcb and all of my personal projects are hosted there. I plan to showcase a few on this blog, so stay tuned!!
